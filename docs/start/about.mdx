`instantdb-react-ui` is a library of react components that seamlessly connects your frontend and backend code with InstantDB. 

- Data queries and updates are automatically built into your UI components. 
- Uses Tanstack Form under the hood to give you type-safety access to all your InstantDB schema entities and fields.
- No more spending time writing manual db mutations or `onSubmit` handlers for every single UI element!
- Automatically load and handle relations and link pickers for all cardinality types
- Debounce/throttle server-side updates forany field with one line of code
- Add `zod` to your instant schema for automatic frontend validation. Our ui components will automatically use zod validation + defaults to show errors and handle your forms.

This library includes two main components with different modes.
- Forms (create and update)
- Lists (normal, infinite, paginated)

<Note>This is not an official library by InstantDB. It is a community-driven project, and PR's are always welcome to improve the project.</Note>
