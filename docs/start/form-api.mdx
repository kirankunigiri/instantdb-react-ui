`useIDBForm` adds several new fields and methods to the tanstack form instance. You can still use all the original tanstack form fields and methods.

The form object has the following fields added, which are also given to you in the `tanstackOptions` callback.

```tsx
interface IDBFormApi {
	/** Updates the database with the current form values */
	handleIDBUpdate: () => void
	/** Creates a new entity in the database with the current form values, and returns the id */
	handleIDBCreate: () => Promise<string | undefined>
	/** Zod schema for the form entity */
	zodSchema: z.ZodObject<any>
}

const form = useIDBForm(...)
// form object has the above IDBFormApi object
```

The fields are also given 2 extra meta fields.

```tsx
export interface IDBFieldMeta<T = any> {
	/** Whether the field has been synced with the database. Only for debounced/throttled fields, which don't update immediately */
	idbSynced: boolean
	/** Data for the relation picker */
	idbLinkData: T extends any[] ? T : T[]
}

// field.state.meta has the above fields
```
