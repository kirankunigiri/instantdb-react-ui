- Better typesafety
- More customization options
- Virtualization for `IDBList`
- Beyond react - Tanstack Form works with other libraries, and currently the `useIDBForm` hook doesn't actually use instantdb/react. It actually just uses the subscription methods from instantdb/core, so it's definitely possible to make this library framework agnostic.
