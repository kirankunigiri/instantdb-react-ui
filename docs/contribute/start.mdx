### Forms
`package/form/form.tsx`
1. Use `createEntityZodSchema` to create a zod schema from the entity and create intiial empty values
2. Use `use-form` hook to create a form with the zod schema resolver and initial values
3. Get relation field picker data for relation fields
4. Run `processChildren` to recursively replace `IDBField` components. These components are cloned, and the form values are passed in so IDBForm has control over their state.
5. For update fields, form state is tracked. We check which fields are dirty (have been edited) and valid, and only run updates for those fields.


#### Mantine Form library
Form state is managed using the `@mantine/form` library with the `use-form` hook.
